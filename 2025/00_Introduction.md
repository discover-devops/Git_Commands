##  What is Version Control System (VCS)?

**Version Control System** is a tool or system that helps you:

* **Track changes** made to code or documents over time.
* **Collaborate** with multiple developers without conflict.
* **Rollback** to previous versions when bugs are introduced.
* Maintain a complete **history** of the project’s evolution.

##  What Does VCS Offer?

| Feature                       | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Version History**        | Every change is recorded. You can revert to older versions anytime.     |
|  **Collaboration** | Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.        |
|  **Branching & Merging**    | Developers can work on isolated branches and merge when ready.          |
|  **Conflict Resolution**   | Helps handle code conflicts during merges.                              |
|  **Backup & Recovery**      | No loss of work—code is stored and versioned securely.                  |
|  **Audit & Tracking**       | Know **who** changed **what**, **when**, and **why** (commit messages). |

##  Types of Version Control Systems

| Type                       | Description                                                           | Example                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Local VCS**              | Stores versions on your local machine. Simple but limited.            | RCS (Revision Control System) |
| **Centralized VCS (CVCS)** | One central server holds all versions. Clients sync with server.      | SVN, CVS                      |
| **Distributed VCS (DVCS)** | Every developer has a full local copy of the repo, including history. | **Git**, Mercurial            |

###  Centralized vs Distributed VCS

| Feature            | Centralized (CVCS)  | Distributed (DVCS)        |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Repository         | Single server       | Every user has full repo  |
| Network Dependency | Required            | Not required              |
| Speed              | Slower for some ops | Very fast (local commits) |
| Examples           | SVN, CVS            | **Git**, Mercurial        |

---

##  Architecture of VCS

Let’s break it down by type:

### 1.  **Centralized VCS Architecture**

```
Developer ↔ Central Repository (e.g. SVN)
            |
            ├── Maintains all version history
            └── All commits, updates happen over network
```

* If the central server fails = risk of **data loss** or **no collaboration**.

---

### 2.  **Distributed VCS Architecture (e.g. Git)**

```
         [ Remote Repository (GitHub, GitLab) ]
                   ↑          ↑
             Push / Pull    Push / Pull
                ↑              ↑
     Dev A (Local Repo)    Dev B (Local Repo)
```

* Everyone has a **full copy** of the repository and history.
* **Commits happen locally**, only sync with remote as needed.
