## In Simple Terms:

### **Git**

* Think of it as the **engine**.
* It runs locally on your machine.
* Used via commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, etc.

###  **GitHub**

* A **cloud garage** where you **store and share** your Git-powered projects.
* Great for open-source, team collab, and has tools like **GitHub Actions** for automation.

### **GitLab**

* Similar to GitHub, but also supports **built-in CI/CD pipelines**, DevOps features, and **self-hosting**.
* You can run GitLab on your **own server**.

###  **Bitbucket**

* Another Git hosting service, tightly **integrated with Jira and Trello**.
* Preferred in teams that already use **Atlassian tools**.

## Analogy:

Imagine you're writing a book with friends:

* **Git** = Your personal **notebook** and **eraser** (you can write, track, and undo anything).
* **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket** = A **shared online locker** where everyone puts their notebooks to collaborate.

  * GitHub = Most popular locker, open-source friendly.
  * GitLab = Locker + automatic printing machine (CI/CD).
  * Bitbucket = Locker integrated with your team planner (Jira).
