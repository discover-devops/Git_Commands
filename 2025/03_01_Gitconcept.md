##  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER `git commit` (Top Section of Diagram)

### Scenario:

You just ran:

```
git commit -m "final update"
```

###  State of All 3 Layers Now:

| Layer                        | State      | Description                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Directory**        | Clean      | The file on disk matches the committed version |
| **Staging Area (Index)**     | Clean      | No changes staged                              |
| **Git Repository (History)** | Up-to-date | The latest snapshot is saved                   |

**Diagram Description:**

* The file (`hello.txt`) is identical in all three places.
* Git shows message: `nothing to commit, working tree clean`

 This is the ideal, synced state.
Nothing pending. Everything is versioned and stored.

---

##  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MODIFICATION (Bottom Section of Diagram)

Now suppose you modify the file:

```
echo "new line" >> hello.txt
```

###  Now the 3 Layers Are Out of Sync:

| Layer                 | State       | Description                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Directory** | Modified    | File has changes not tracked by Git yet                     |
| **Staging Area**      | Old version | Has the previous version from the last `git add` (or empty) |
| **Git Repository**    | Still old   | No new commit has been made                                 |

**Diagram Description:**

* Working Directory now has **a newer version**.
* Staging Area and Git Repository still have **the older copy**.
* Git shows message: `modified: hello.txt`

 Git **does nothing automatically** — it waits for your command:

> Git is just a tool — it will follow your order

You must now run:

```
git add hello.txt
```

Then:

```
git commit -m "your new message"
```

##  Git Workflow Recap (Tied to Your Diagram)

| Action                   | Result                                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| File created or modified | OS only has it                                           |
| `git add`                | Moves it to staging (preparing for commit)               |
| `git commit`             | Saves it to history, all layers are synced again         |
| File modified again      | Only working directory changes, needs new add and commit |

---

##  Final Thought

Your diagram clearly shows:

1. After `git commit`, **all three layers match**
2. If file is modified again, only **Working Directory changes**
3. Git **takes no automatic decision** — it's command-driven
