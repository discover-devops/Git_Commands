##  What Happens *After* `git commit`?

After you run:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Here’s what happens in terms of the **3 Git areas**:

| Area                         | State of the File                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Directory**        |  File is present and unchanged             |
| **Staging Area (Index)**     |  Now empty — Git clears it after commit    |
| **Git Repository (History)** |  Snapshot of the file is saved permanently |

---

###  So, Are All 3 in Sync?

* Yes, they are **functionally in sync** **if no further changes** are made to the file.
* All 3 layers have the **same content** of the file version at that point.

BUT:

* The **Staging Area is emptied** after a successful commit. It holds files *only before* the commit.
* So technically, the "sync" is between:

  * Your **Working Directory**
  * The **latest Commit**
* And the staging area becomes idle until the next `git add`.

---

###  Example Timeline

Let’s say:

1. You create `hello.txt`
2. `git add hello.txt` → goes to Staging
3. `git commit` → goes to Repository

Now all match. But:

4. You edit `hello.txt` again.
5. Now:

   * Working Directory:  changed
   * Staging Area:  old version (or empty)
   * Repository:  previous snapshot

→ Git will now show: "Modified, not staged for commit"

###  Summary:

| Area              | After `commit`                       | Notes |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Working Directory |  In sync with repo (unless changed) |       |
| Staging Area      |  Cleared (empty)                    |       |
| Repository (.git) |  Stores the committed version       |       |
